= Coin Acceptor (DG600F) demo with Arduino Uno

== Intro

Example for DG600F (S).

The sample configures 2 inputs and 3 outputs.

In the sample, only one input is used to reset the current balance: PIN 2

In the sample, PIN 6 and 7 are connected to LEDs.
PIN6 makes the LED blinks when a coin is detected.
PIN7 blinks when enough is paid.
PIN9 is illuminated when an error occurs.
